# Siege Learning App
An app made in Unity3D to teach about room names, camera and hatch locations for the video game Rainbow Six Siege.
An executable of the app can be run in the Build folder. It is called "R6MapLearning.exe".

## Features

- Contains 20 different maps to learn about.
- Each map has three topics to learn: Room Names, Cameras and Hatches.
- You can study to answers in the research sections and then try to complete the tests.
- For Room Names you have to click on the question marked box that matches the location of the stated room name.
- For Cameras you have to click on the image where you think the cameras are. The game will tell you how many per floor there are.
- For Hatches the game will ask you to choose what room a certain hatch will drop into.
- Each game is timed, with your best completion time being saved on the game menu.
- You have 3 lives to succeed. Once your lives run out you will have to retry.
- Each map is broken up into the different floors of the building.
